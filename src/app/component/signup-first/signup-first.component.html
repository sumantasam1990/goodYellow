          <p class="HeroNew fw-bold mt-4 mb-4 fs-6">
            Congrats on signing up as a Partner on Good Yellow. Good Yellow is a first of its kind marketplace. This is
            where you will create your Good Yellow account and storefront. Please be aware that this process will take a
            little bit of time but you can stop and come back to anything that you’ve saved.


          </p>

          <p class="HeroNew fw-bold mt-4 mb-4 fs-6">
            Before you start, please take time to read the VERY important information in the next 5 pages before you
            start creating your account and storefront.


          </p>

          <p class="HeroNew fw-bold mt-4 mb-4 fs-6">
            We charge ZERO transaction fees and ZERO listing fees. This will save small businesses thousands of dollars
            or more per year.


          </p>

          <p class="HeroNew fw-bold mt-4 mb-4 fs-6">
            Second, we have a one-of-a-kind Leaderboard and Leaderboard List concept which will enable small businesses
            to gain visibility amongst consumers and our Members like never before. No other ecommerce place online
            offers anything like our Leaderboard and Leaderboard Lists concept which provides small businesses with
            benefits that they won’t get on any other marketplace or ecommerce place online.


          </p>

          <p class="HeroNew fw-bold mt-4 mb-4 fs-6">
            Third, your customers remain your customers, you communicate directly with your customers, they order
            directly from you, they pay you directly and even on their credit card statements, they will see your
            Brand’s name.


          </p>

          <p class="HeroNew fw-bold mt-4 mb-4 fs-6">
            Finally, we will have a 70/30 revenue share with our Partners from the small monthly or annual membership
            fee that our Members will be paying in order to shop on Good Yellow. 70% will go to our Partners (more on
            this in later pages). This revenue share applies only for Members who sign up with your promo code that
            you’ll create when you make your account. This promo code gives anyone signing up with your promo code, a 30
            day free trial.
