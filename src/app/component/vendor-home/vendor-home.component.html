          We only accept brands who we've invited to join Good Yellow. If we've invited you to join, please click "Get
          Early Access" above so that we know that you're interested in accepting your invitation. We will be launching
          in August 25th 2022. We will send you a registration link which will allow you to create a Brand Page and
          start
          adding your products and brand info to Good Yellow so that customers can start placing orders.

          Are there really no fees for brands?
        </h2>
        <p class="fw-bold">
          Yes 100%. We believe in brands being able to keep every penny that the customer pays in their order (minus
          credit card processing fees, we don't control that). We don't charge any listing fees or any transaction fees
          like other e-commerce retailers or marketplaces.

        <p class="fw-bold">
          We will be charging a $9 per month membership fee for customers. We believe that we are bring tremendous value
          proposition to customers since we will have hundreds or brands and thousands of products in one place that are
          good for you, good for the planet or good for society. Rather than having to go to multiple different websites
          to buy items from multiple different brands, customers can just come to one website, add items from those
          brands once and checkout once. Also customers will be able to find out much more about the founders and the
          story behind each brand. By buying items from each brand on Good Yellow, customers are also helping that brand
          with more visibility on Good Yellow's leaderboard. Our leaderboard on the homepage displays each brand in
          order of how many sales they have had on Good Yellow. This is exclusive to Good Yellow.

          collected in your Stripe account and from there you can transfer it to your bank account. This enables you to
          not have to share any card or banking information with Good Yellow.

          Will I be able to create a storefront?
        </h2>
        <p class="fw-bold">
          Yes, just like on Shopify or Wix, you will be able to create a storefront on Good Yellow with all of the
          needed e-commerice features such as receiving orders, marking orders as shipped, seeing when orders are
          delivered, adding promotions or discounts to orders and much more. But you will also be able to create a Brand
          Page where you will be required to upload photos of the founders and people behind the brand such as the
          farmers or people where you source your ingredients from. You will also be required to add 5 sections of text
          that shares written details about your brand such as the story, the ingredients, the cause that you don't a
          portion of your profits to and why and more. We require this because we want members of Good Yellow to connect
          to founders, people and the story behind brands in a very close and direct way like they have never before on
          other places online.
