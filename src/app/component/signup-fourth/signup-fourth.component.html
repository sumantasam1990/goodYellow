            The fastest and best way is to offer your existing customers a great discount that is exclusively available
            on your Good Yellow storefront for a few days. Because you already have the list of customers, all you have
            to do is email them the information about the discount and your Good Yellow storefront link. Your customers
            will have to become Good Yellow Members at $9 per month (or $39 per year) with the use of a promo code.
            Since each product sold through storefronts on Good Yellow is required to have at least a 5% discount, Good
            Yellow is a membership-based ecommerce destination. Just like Thrive Market or Costco but much cheaper,
            exclusively for small businesses and a much more unique and better experience for consumers of discovering
            Brands that fit with what theyâ€™re looking for in Brands (i.e the titles of Leaderboards).

            This is where the 70%/30% revenue share will come from that we will be splitting with our Partners.

          <p class="HeroNew fw-bold mt-4 mb-4 fs-6">
            The better the discount you offer to your existing customers, the more of them will come, place an order and
            the faster you climb every Leaderboard and Leaderboard Lists that your Brand is on. Consumers and Members
            will see how many total sales and different customers your Brand has had on Good Yellow. We will also
            display your highest offered discount percentage at that time, on all of the Leaderboards that your product
            is included in. This will give you another opportunity to grab the attention of consumers and Members
            towards your Storefront.

          <p class="HeroNew fw-bold mt-4 mb-4 fs-6">
            We will be launching for consumers on August 20, 2022. So between now and then, please start marketing your
            upcoming and soon to be launched Good Yellow Storefront and the great discounts that you will be offering to

            ready to place an order and you can climb all of the Leaderboards and Leaderboard Lists that you will be on,
